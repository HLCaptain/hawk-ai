# Hawk AI

Hawk AI is a set of solutions help to aid ADAS and Autonomous Driving Systems. It relies on digital data generation curtesy of [BeamNG](https://www.beamng.tech/), a vehicle simulation platform. The data is then processed and analyzed using machine learning algorithms to provide insights and predictions on the vehicle's behavior.

The repository contains python code to generate data with in-game "AI" drivers with your desired sensors and circumstances.

## Installation

For installation, you have to install [BeamNGpy](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy) and request access to [BeamNG.tech](https://www.beamng.tech/). You can install the python framework using pip:

```sh
pip install beamngpy
```

## Usage

To generate data with BeamNG, run `data-generation/beamng-scripts/beamng_data_generation.py`. You can specify your data generation strategy in code.
